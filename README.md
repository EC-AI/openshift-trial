# VM Runtime OpenCV demo

## About

This sample application demonstrates the use of [OpenCV][1] using App
Engine's VM Runtime feature. The application allows a user to upload
an image of a Sudoku puzzle. The app then solves the puzzle and displays
the solution on the image.

Code was used and modified from the following sources:

- [OpenCV Python Tutorials blog][2]
- [Peter Norvig's blog][3]
- [OpenCV's square detector sample][4]
